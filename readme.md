# WPS — WordPress plugin for whoops

WPS adds [whoops](http://filp.github.io/whoops/) error handler to a WordPress installation and injects WP–specific data into it.

This plugin is a fork of @Rarst [wps](https://github.com/Rarst/wps).

I'm not sure I'm going to maintain this.
You should consider use original version.
Unlike Rarst version this one require PHP 5.4+
